## Licenses
If you haven't noticed, there are 2 Licenses in this Repo. I'm not sure if this is allowed so if it isn't ignore everything except the Apache 2.0 License, especially if the other License(s) are not legally biding, I would consult with a legal professional but I'm pretty sure that requires money.
